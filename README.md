## Why would you want to do this?
Maintaining OPSEC, mostly. This combined with judicial use of private lists and
multiple accounts is an effective way I've found to read a lot of Twitter,
without it reading so much about me. 

I was originally planning on doing my own desktop Twitter client that does all
of this, but if I'm not busy, I'm lazy.

## Installation?
* Clone the repository
* Ensure/entrust the code isn't going to steal your bank account details
* Under "Extensions" in Chrome, "Load unpacked extension"
* F5 any existing Tweetdeck tabs open 

## Stork?
Are mute birds.

## License?
